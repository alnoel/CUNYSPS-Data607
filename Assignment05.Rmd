# Analyze Israeli COVID Vaccination Data of August 2021 

The initial data is in a spreadsheet for which an image is provided by retrieval of 
a file stored on GitHub.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alnoel/CUNYSPS-Data607/main/IsraeliCOVIDVax_August2021.png)

## Tasks

The tasks are to: 

1. Create a CSV file including information in the spreadsheet. Make the file wide.
2. Read the CSV file into R and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to transform and tidy data.
3. Perform analysis:
    + Do we have enough information to calculate the total population? What does this total population represent?
    + Calculate efficacy vs. disease Explain your results.
    + From the calculation of efficacy vs. disease, are we able to compare the rate
    of severe cases in un-vaccinated individuals to that in vaccinated individuals? 
4. In the analysis note any discrepancies observed.

## Domain Knowledge to be Gathered and Used in Analysis


1. Israel's total population
2. Who is eligible to receive vaccinations?
3. What does it mean to be fully vaccinated? 


## Retrieve CSV File from GitHub
```{r retrieve-vax-data}
library(curl)
vaxdata <- 
read.csv (curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alnoel/CUNYSPS-Data607/main/vaxdataIsrael_082021.csv"))
str(vaxdata)
```



## Domain Knowledge

1. Israel's total population is approximately 8,819,523. The
source of this number is: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/israel-population/

*"The current population of Israel is 8,819,523 as of Sunday, September 19, 2021,
based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data."*


2. As of August 2021 Israel had been only vaccinating those 12 - 15 since around the end of June.
Israel's population is younger on average than many other developed countries. There is
approximately 27% in the bracket 0-14 years. 
3. In general, at this point in time before booster/third shots have been widely used, 
people are considered fully vaccinated: Â± 2 weeks after their second dose in a 2-dose series, 
such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or  2 weeks after a single-dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson's
Janssen vaccine. Israel has used only the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to date. 



## Analysis of Population

```{r vax-total}
total <- sum(vaxdata$notvax,vaxdata$fullyvax,echo=FALSE)
print(paste("The total from the spreadsheet is: ", total)) 
diff <- 8819523 - total 
print(paste("The difference between the approximate total population and the spreadsheet total differs by: ",diff))
```


1,722,454 / 8,819,523 = 19.5%. At least 19% of the country's total population is not included
in the spreadsheet vaccination data. The use of the term population in the spread sheet data must
mean the total of only those eligible. We know there is approximately 27% of the country's total
population that was not eligible to be vaccinated until sometime in June 2021. Israel
did not start vaccinating those ages 12 - 15 until June. 
And there is the group under 12 who as of yet are not being vaccinated.  
**There is the country's total population and there is the spreadsheet vaccination total population.
They are not synonymous. Population in the spreadsheet is those eligible.**

## Analysis of Efficacy

Efficacy is the ability to produce a desired or intended result. The primary 
purpose of vaccination has been to reduce severe illness. That is the 
desired result and not protection from all illness levels of severity.   

We are able to analyze the efficacy of vaccination in the 
context of who were, or recently, eligible. We cannot assume
the data considers the partially vaccinated. If we total 
the percentages for those 50 and under it is 96.3% and
98.3% for those over 50, not 100% in either case. The
3.7% and 1.7% respectively values for less than 100% 
may be the percentages of those partially vaccinated.

We are only considering data for severe disease, hospitalization. Most likely 
in the case of Israel severe disease always results in hospitalization. That may not
be true elsewhere in world where there are much less capable
health care systems.

The severity of COVID infection ranges from no symptoms to mild, moderate,
severe and critical. 


Category    | Symptoms
----------- | -------------
mild        | fever, cough, sore throat, malaise
moderate    | evidence of lower respiratory disease
severe      | Oxygen saturation < 94%
critical    | respiratory failure and/or multiple organ dysfunction 


### Calculate Efficacy

The rate of severe disease for those 50 and under
drops from 43 per 100,000 to 11 when going from those
not vaccinated to those who are. This seems consistent with 
what I think should be occurring. However, the rate of severe disease for those over 50 is not less 
for those vaccinated but rather greater. The unvaccinated rate is 171 but 
the vaccinated is 290. This is not consistent with what I would expect.
Calculating the efficacy supports suspecting something is awry with the datum. 


```{r calculate-efficacy, echo = FALSE}
total50andunder <- vaxdata$severenot[1] + vaxdata$severefully[1] 
eff50andunder <- 1 - ((vaxdata$severefully[1]/total50andunder)/ (vaxdata$severenot[1]/total50andunder))
totalover50 <- vaxdata$severenot[2] + vaxdata$severefully[2]
effover50 <- 1 - ((vaxdata$severefully[2]/totalover50 )/ (vaxdata$severenot[2]/totalover50 ))
prnthold <- paste('The efficacy for fifty and under is: ', round((eff50andunder*100),2),'%', sep ='')
print(prnthold)
prnthold <- paste('The efficacy for over 50 is: ', round((effover50*100),2),'%', sep ='')
print(prnthold)


```


Israel is using the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both of the mRNA type. The efficacy for both 
based on the clinical trials is about 95%. Yet we see in the 
category of those 50 and under the efficacy is around 74%, approximately
20% less. That is plausible. Efficacy of vaccination varies with the vaccine, the age, and health of the
individual. It takes time to build immunity and immunity
dissipates over time. The maximum level of immunity achieved also
varies. 


Quoting https://yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison,
which was most recently updated September 17, 2021. 

> "In one CDC study, data from the state of New York showed for mRNA vaccines
> effectiveness dropping from 91.7 to 79% against infection."  



### Update vaxdata Data Frame with Efficacy
```{r update-data-frame}
vaxdata$efficacy[1] <- eff50andunder
vaxdata$efficacy[2] <- effover50
```



## Conclusions

We are only able to determine the population of those eligible and
not the total population of the country. 

We are only able to compare the efficacy of vaccination for those
50 and under. In this category the efficacy is quite good and
understandably not quite as good as the trials data.
